# Let's check some answers...
# Write statements which answer the following questions:

# Is a bigger than b?
print(a > b) # quick way!

# is_bigger = a > b
# print(is_bigger)

# Is c less than or equal to b?
print(c <= b)

# Is d NOT equal to c?
print(d != c)

# Does a equal to half of c?
print(a == (c/2))
