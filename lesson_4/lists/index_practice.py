# INDEX PRACTICE

# The elements have the following indices
#		  0			1		2		3	   4
pets = ['bird', 'rabbit', 'dog', 'frog', 'cat']

# To access 'frog' we use its index
my_pet = pets[3]

# To access 'cat' we can use a positive index
your_pet = pets[4]





# NEGATIVE INDICES

# The elements have the following indices
#		  0			1		2		3	   4
# and also negative indices
#		  -5	   -4	    -3	   -2	  -1
pets = ['bird', 'rabbit', 'dog', 'frog', 'cat']

# To access 'frog' we use its negative index
frog_pet = pets[-2]

# To access 'cat' we can use a negative index
cat_pet = pets[-1]
